### Frameworks

Frameworks generate commonly used code to streamline and accelerate
the development process in the early stages. These are essentially
a bundle of css that can be used to jumpstart a project.

Some popular examples include Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, and Foundation.

The disadvantage to frameworks is that when using them too early,
it can stunt the learning process of vanilla css.
They are very useful tools only after css as a plain language
has been learned and mastered.

Additionally, when using frameworks, it can be more difficult 
to debug style issues if css fundamentals are weak.

## Preprocessors

Preprocessors are languages that can help write css more easily.
They reduce code repetition and assist in saving time and codespace.

Some popular examples include SASS, LESS, and Stylus.

At this point, most of the helpful features that preprocessors provided
are now implemented in base css, so the overhead may be too much
for too little assistance from the preprocessor.
