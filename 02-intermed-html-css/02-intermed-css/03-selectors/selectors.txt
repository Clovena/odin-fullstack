### Advanced Selectors

## Child Combinator

To select direct children, use > as follows:
main > div {
  /* CSS here */
}
This is different than the below:
main div {
  /* CSS here */
}
The latter will operate on every single <div> within <main>
whereas the former with the child combinator will only operate on
<div>s that are immediate children of <main>.

This comes into play with nested divs, for instance. 
<main>
  <div> # This div, as an immediate child of main, would be affected by the child combinator.
    <div></div> # This div would not be affected when using the child combinator.
  </div>
</main>


## Sibling Combinators

To operate on elements that are immediately following certain other elements, 
use the sibling combinator + as follows:

/* Only the div with the classes "child group2" will get selected by this */
.group1 + div {
  /* Our cool CSS */
}

/* Only the div with the classes "child group3" will get selected by this */
.group1 + div + div {
  /* More cool CSS */
}

Sibling combinators only operate on one element; that is, the sibling 
immediately after the original element, and nothing beyond it.

The General Sibling Combinator can be used if *all* siblings are desired:

/* All of .group1's div siblings - in this case the 2nd and 3rd .child divs, will get selected by this */
.group1 ~ div {
  /* Our cool CSS */
}
