### Positioning

Static positioning is the default in css and is represented by position: static;
The properties top, bottom, left, right do not affect the position of the element
in a static context. 

Relative positioning (position: relative;) is very similar to static,
but top, bottom, left, right will displace the element relative to its standard position.

Absolute positioning (position: absolute;) looks for an exact position on the screen 
without disturbing the flow of any other elements around it. 
This should be used in very specific circumstances, not to work through an entire page layout.

Fixed positioning (position: fixed;) are also removed from the standard flow of a page, 
but unlike absolute positioning which is based on the page itself, 
fixed positioning is based on the viewport. 
That is, a fixed element will stay in the exact same spot on the screen;
an absolute element will stay in the exact same spot on the page.

Sticky positioning (position: sticky;) is like a combination of static and fixed;
while a sticky element is below the top of the viewport, it will behave static,
but once it is scrolled past, it will become fixed into the viewport.
