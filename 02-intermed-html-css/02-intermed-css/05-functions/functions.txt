### Functions

Functions in css are just like functions in other programming languages.
They are denoted with parens after the function name, like rgb().


## calc()

calc() is used to mix units and enter values that are based on other values.
:root {
--header: 3rem;
--footer: 40px;
--main: calc(100vh - calc(var(--header) + var(--footer)));
}
(fwiw: those three attributes that begin with -- are actually css variables. More to come.)


## min()

Naturally, min() takes the minimum of all values.
#iconHolder {
  width: min(150px, 100%);
  height: min(150px, 100%);
}
This element will take up the space of 150px in both dimensions, if those 150px are available.
If its parent is smaller than 150px, then it will take up 100% of the parent's size. 

min() can also handle basic calculations without the use of calc(), e.g.
width: min(80ch, 100vw - 2rem);


## max()

max() takes the maximum of two values.
width: max(100px, 4em, 50%);


## clamp()

clamp() is good at making elements fluid and responsive. 
It takes three arguments: the smallest value, the ideal value, and the largest value.
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(320px, 80vw, 60rem);
}
