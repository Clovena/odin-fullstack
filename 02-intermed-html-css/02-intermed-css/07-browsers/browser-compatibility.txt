### Browser Compatibility

In this day and age there are a number of browsers to consider
when web developing.
Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Brave, Opera... plus mobile OSes!

Different browsers use different engines to display webpage info:
Chrome uses Blink;
Safari uses Webkit;

"Can I Use" (https://caniuse.com/) is a good resource to check
if certain new features in html/css/etc are compatible with various browsers.

The two most popular mobile OSes are, of course, Android and iOS.

On iOS, the only web browser that can be used is Safari (Webkit). 
Even by downloading and using Firefox or Chrome, that's not 
actually using those engines. They're still using Webkit.
