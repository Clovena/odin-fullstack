### Units

## Absolute Units

These are units that are the same in any context.
The only real web-based absolute unit is `px`.
`in` and `cm` can be used but are better in print contexts.

## Relative Units

These are units that can change based on their context.
`em` and `rem` both refer to a font size. `rem` is preferred, generally.

An element always has a font-size of 1em.
This allows for calculations to be done based around font-size and em.
If an element has a font-size of 16px, then 1em = 16px for that element
(and all its children that inherit that font-size). 
Then, if width is set to 4em, this is equivalent to 64px (16px * 4em = 64px).

The difference between em and rem is that rem refers to 
the root element font-size (either :root or html).
Using rem sidesteps the necessity of keeping track of the parent size
and simply refers to the highest order of size. 
Then, there is no risk of size changing if lower-level context changes.

Using rem is highly preferred, as it respects a user's font-size preferences.
It is flexible and dynamic, and everything on the page is related in size.

## Viewport Units

`vh` and `vw` relate to the size of the viewport (screen).

1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height, 
and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.

## Line Height Units

`lh` and `rlh` are relative units much like `em` and `rem`. 
lh is relative to the height of the element itself,
and rlh is relative to the height of the root element. 

## Percentages

Percentages can be used to denote a proportion of a parent element.
Percentages are always relative to a value for the same attribute.
That is, if a child element has a width of 50%, it will refer to
the width of the parent element (and assume half the width of that parent).
