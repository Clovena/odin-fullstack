### Text Styles

## System Fonts

As seen in Foundations, css is often written with a font stack.
body {
  font-family: system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
}
Note that fonts are separated with a comma.

## Web Fonts

For fonts not necessarily available by default on users' devices,
fonts must be imported from an online source - a font library or a site asset.

Font libraries can be imported as a <link> in html...
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Racing+Sans+One&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

as an @import in the <head> of html...
<style>
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Racing+Sans+One&display=swap');
</style>

or as an @import at the top of css.
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Racing+Sans+One&display=swap')

## Self Hosted Fonts

Fonts downloaded as a file(s) can be included in a workspace as an asset.
@font-face {
  font-family: my-cool-font;
  src: url(../fonts/the-font-file.woff);
}

h1 {
  font-family: my-cool-font, sans-serif;
}

## More Text-Related Properties in css

font-style:
  italic (when used as a style choice; still use <em> for specific emphasis in text)

letter-spacing:
  Default is 0. Can use em/rem as options in both positive (0.5rem) and negative (-0.15em) directions.

line-height:
  Much like line spacing in a word processor, etc. Default is 1. 

text-transform:
  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform for details

text-shadow:
  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow for details

text-overflow: ellipsis;
  This is used in cases where text spans beyond its parent element. 
  With this parameter, text will render with an ellipsis at the end of 
  what fits within the parent element.
