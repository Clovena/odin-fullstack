### Grid and Flexbox

When should grid be used over flexbox? 
When should flexbox be used over grid?

Design, among other things, dictates this.

In Content-First design, a dev has a clear vision
of what the content should be, and the layout will come.
This is prime flexbox territory, as flexbox would allow
for the behavior of content to be controlled.

In Layout-First design, a dev has a clear vision 
of what the layout should be, and the content will come. 
This is where grid shines, as developing grid tracks first 
gives full control over layout ahead of time. 


## Combining Flexbox and Grid

With one-dimensional content, flexbox is helpful
to control that content within a 1D flex container. 

In two-dimensional content, grid allows easier use
across defined rows and columns. 

It can sometimes be most beneficial to set up a page layout
in an overall grid display, but each grid item can behave 
as a flex container. This way, the grid items can be 
positioned with precise two-dimensional placement,
while also allowing the content inside each grid item
to be capable of freely moving around using flex.
